## Note

----------------

Dear flowSpy users:

To improve the identification of this package and avoid awkward duplication of names in some situations, we decided to change the name of `flowSpy` to `CytoTree`. The package name of `CytoTree` more fits the functional orientation of this software. The usage and update of `flowSpy` and `CytoTree` will be consistent until the end of Bioc 3.11. And for the 3.12 devel, flowSpy will be deprecated.

The package `CytoTree` has been added to Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/CytoTree/), we recommend that users can download this package and replace `flowSpy` as soon as possible.

We apologized for the inconvenience.
